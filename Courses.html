        Political science is the scientific study of politics. 
        It is a social science dealing with systems of governance and power,
         and the analysis of political activities, political thought,
          political behavior, and associated constitutions and laws.

               <p style="color: aliceblue;">Can generally be divided into the three subdisciplines of comparative politics,
                 international relations, and political theory. Other notable subdisciplines are public policy and administration,
                  domestic politics and government, political economy, and political methodology. Furthermore, 
                  political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, 
                  history, philosophy, human geography, political anthropology, and psychology.

                  <p style="color: aliceblue;">Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology, 
                    social research, and political philosophy. Approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, 
                    behaviouralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralism. Political science, 
                    as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquires sought: primary sources,
                     such as historical documents and official records, and secondary sources, such as scholarly journal articles, survey research,
                      statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building.

                Chronology of the universe as deduced by the prevailing Big Bang theory, a result from science and obtained knowledge
                The earliest written records of identifiable predecessors to modern science come from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia 
                from around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek 
                natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical
                 world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated
                  in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic
                   Golden Age and later by the efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars who brought Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe in the Renaissance.

                  <p style="color: aliceblue;">The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic 
                    inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy",
                    which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as
                     new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions.
                     The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century
                      that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape,along with the changing 
                      of "natural philosophy" to "natural science".Modern science is typically divided into three major branches:natural sciences (
                        e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology),
                         which study individuals and societies;and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science),
                          which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules.There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines,
                          because they do not rely on empirical evidence. Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes,
                           such as in engineering and medicine.

                using data to inform their physical education programs.
                Can help educators and researchers identify trends and patterns in physical activity,

                    STATISTICS:</h3>
                  <p style="color: aliceblue;">1. Descriptive statistics - summarize and describe characteristics of a dataset.
                     In physical education, they're used to
                    describe the distribution of fitness levels, activity levels, and other outcomes among students.

                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p style="color: aliceblue;">2. Inferential statistics - make inferences about a population from a sample. In physical education, they can compare
                    groups like fitness levels between boys and girls.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                 </p>
                 <p style="color: aliceblue;">3. Correlation - analysis examines the relationship between two variables, and can be used in physical education to
                  examine the relationship between fitness levels and academic performance.
                  <br>
                  <br>
               </p>
               <p style="color: aliceblue;">4. Regression analysis - examines the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent
                variables, and can be used in physical education to examine the relationship between fitness levels and factors like age,
                gender, or socioeconomic status.

                <br>
             </p>
             <p style="color: aliceblue;">5. Factor analysis - identifies patterns in a dataset to group variables related to fitness or activity levels in physical
              education. ANOVA can determine significant differences in fitness levels between groups based on a continuous
              dependent variable, such as age or activity level.
